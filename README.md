## Description

The Note Taker project is a web application that allows users to write and save notes. As a small business owner or any user who needs to organize thoughts and keep track of tasks, the application helps users store notes conveniently. The application uses an Express.js back end to handle data storage and retrieval, and it saves note data in a JSON file.

## Technologies Used 
The Note Taker application is built using Express.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages JSON for data storage and exchange, allowing users to write and save notes. Heroku is used for deployment, hosting the app on a live URL. Git and GitHub facilitate version control and collaboration. npm handles package management, and the fs module in Node.js enables file system operations for data storage. This combination of technologies creates a user-friendly and efficient note-taking app, with a back end handling data management and a front end offering a seamless user experience.
